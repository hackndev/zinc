/*!
Zinc is an embedded stack for rust.

Zinc provides a complete embedded stack for application development in rust. It
is provided in a form of library, compiled for a specific MCU, that can be
linked into user's own applications.

### Supported architectures

ARM is the only architecture, supported at the moment. Zinc can be compiled for
"native" architecture as well, which should be useful only for testing the code,
though.

### Supported ARM MCUs

Two MCUs are supported at the moment, specifically

 * NXP LPC1768
 * ST STM32F407
 * ST STM32L152RCT6
 * Freescale MK20DX32
 * TI TM4C123GXL

The code is generic enough to support other MCUs in the same family (LPC17xx and
STM32F403/407).
